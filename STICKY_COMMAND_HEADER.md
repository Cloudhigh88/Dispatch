Sticky Command Header in Warp

## Overview
The Sticky Command Header in Warp shows the command run for a large Block that is scrolled partially off-screen. This feature helps users see the command that was previously run or is currently running, allowing for easy navigation back to the top of the Block.

## How to Access Sticky Command Header
- The Sticky Command Header is enabled by default.
- To toggle the Sticky Command Header:
  - Go to **Settings > Features** and toggle **“Show sticky command header.”**
  - Search for **“Sticky Command Header”** within the Command Palette.
  - Set up a key binding in **Settings > Keyboard Shortcuts**.
  - You can also "Toggle the Sticky Command Header in the Active Pane" from the Command Palette or by setting up a key binding. This minimizes the feature on the active session without disabling it entirely.

## How to Use Sticky Command Header
- If a Block has a large output (e.g., `seq 1 1000`), the header of the Block will show at the top of the active Window, Tab, or Pane.
- Click on the Sticky Command Header to quickly jump to the top of the Block.
- While active, you can minimize the Sticky Command Header on the active pane by clicking the UP/DOWN arrow in the middle of the header.

This guide will assist users in understanding and utilizing the Sticky Command Header effectively within the Warp terminal.
