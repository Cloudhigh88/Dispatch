# Working Directory in Warp

## Overview
Warp's working directory feature enhances your workflow by allowing you to set a default directory for new sessions. This feature saves time and enables quick access to preferred directories when starting new sessions. You can set up a working directory for all new sessions or customize it individually for Windows, Tabs, and Panes based on your specific needs.

## How to Access the Working Directory Feature
- Open **Settings > Features > Session** and navigate to "Working directory for new sessions".

### Options for Working Directory
The drop-down for this feature provides several options:

1. **Home Directory**: 
   - This is the default option for new sessions, opening new sessions in the currently logged-in user's home folder (`~/`).

2. **Previous Session's Directory**: 
   - This option opens new sessions in the active session's current directory.

3. **Custom Directory**: 
   - This option allows you to specify a file path to open new sessions in a directory of your choice.

4. **Advanced**: 
   - This option allows you to select from the three options for new sessions in Windows, Tabs, and Panes.

This guide will assist users in understanding and utilizing the Working Directory feature effectively within the Warp terminal.
