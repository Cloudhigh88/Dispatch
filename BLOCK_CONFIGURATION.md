# Block Configuration for Warp Terminal

## Overview
Warp allows users to customize their Blocks in various ways, enhancing the terminal experience. This includes enabling Compact mode and adjusting block dividers.

2. Alternatively, use the Command Palette and search for "Compact mode" to toggle it.

### Persistence
Warp will remember the compact settings and open with the same configuration in future sessions.
