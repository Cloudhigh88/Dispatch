# Workspace Management in Warp Drive

## Overview
Warp Drive provides a personal workspace for storing and organizing Workflows, Notebooks, Prompts, and Environment Variables. If you are part of a team, your team’s workspace will also be accessible.

## Organizing Objects in Warp Drive
- Objects (e.g., Workflows, Notebooks, Prompts, Environment Variables) and folders can be sorted alphabetically or by the last updated.
- Any objects moved from your personal workspace into a team’s workspace will be shared with all team members.
- It is not possible to move an item back from a team’s workspace into a personal workspace. If you shared something inadvertently, copy the contents to your clipboard, recreate it in your personal workspace, and delete the object from the team workspace.
- You cannot drag a folder of personal Workflows into a team workspace; objects must be moved one at a time.

## Using Warp Drive Offline
- In offline mode, some files will be read-only. You can create and edit files in your personal space, but they will only be saved locally and not synced. These files cannot be moved into a team or deleted until you are back online.

## Navigating Warp Drive with Your Keyboard
To navigate through Warp Drive using the keyboard:
- Press UP/DOWN or j/k to navigate to the desired object.
- Press Enter to execute an object, open/collapse a workspace or folder, or open the trash.
- Press CMD-ENTER to open an object’s context menu.
- Press CMD-SHIFT-( and CMD-SHIFT-) to switch focus between the terminal and Warp Drive.
- Press LEFT-ARROW to collapse a workspace or folder.
- Press RIGHT-ARROW to open a workspace or folder.
- Press Esc to return to Warp Drive from your trash.

## Importing and Exporting Objects
### Importing Files into Warp Drive
To import a local file or directory:
1. RIGHT-CLICK on a folder or click + on a workspace and choose "Import."
2. Supported files in the directory and its sub-directories will be imported into a matching folder structure.

### Exporting Files from Warp Drive
To export a single object:
1. RIGHT-CLICK on the object and choose "Export," then select a directory for export.
2. To export all objects, open the Command Palette, search for "Export all Warp Drive Objects," and select a directory for export.

## Sharing Your Drive Objects
Every object in Warp Drive can be shared in three ways:
- **Teams**: All members of a Warp team have full access to the objects in its Drive.
- **Direct Sharing**: Objects can be shared directly with individuals by email.
- **Link-based Sharing**: Make an object public to anyone with the link, including those without Warp accounts.

### Managing Permissions
To manage a Drive object's permissions:
1. Navigate to its overflow menu and choose "Share."
2. You can invite other users directly using the email input, change public link access levels, and update individual user access.

## Troubleshooting Warp Drive
- If you were previously using Warp on your own and later invited to join a team, exit, update, and restart the Warp app to gain access to your team’s shared drive and commands.
- Navigating to **Settings > Teams** in Warp can force a metadata update, ensuring access to the latest versions of Workflows in your team's drive.

This guide will assist users in effectively managing their workspaces in Warp Drive for improved collaboration and organization.
