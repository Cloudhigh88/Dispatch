# Plan to Build a Copy of the Warp Terminal

## 1. Research and Analysis
- Analyze the existing features of the Warp terminal, including:
  - GPU acceleration for improved performance.
  - Compatibility with various shell environments (zsh, bash, fish, PowerShell).
  - Built-in AI functionalities for enhanced user experience.
  - Modern user interface design.
  - Support for collaborative features and workflows.
- Identify key functionalities that need to be replicated.

## 2. Technology Stack
- Choose programming languages, primarily Rust for performance.
- Select frameworks and libraries for UI development, such as React for the frontend and Electron for desktop applications.
- Use Actix or Rocket for any backend services if needed.
- Implement state management using Redux or Context API.
- Establish testing frameworks like JUnit or Mocha for unit and integration testing.
- Utilize Cargo as the Rust package manager and build system.

## 3. Architecture Design
- Define the overall architecture of the application, including:
  - Terminal Emulator: The core component that handles input and output, processes commands, and interacts with the shell.
  - User Interface: A modern UI that allows users to interact with the terminal, including features like tabs, split panes, and customizable themes.
  - Backend Services: If needed, services that handle additional functionalities such as user settings, collaboration features, and AI integrations.
  - State Management: A system to manage the application state, ensuring that user preferences and terminal sessions are maintained.
  - Plugin System: An architecture that allows for extensibility, enabling users to add custom features or integrations.
  - Communication Layer: A mechanism for communication between the terminal emulator and the backend services, possibly using WebSockets for real-time interactions.
- Outline components and their interactions, such as how the terminal emulator processes user input and communicates with the backend, how the UI components like tabs and split panes interact with the state management system, and how plugins integrate with the core application to extend functionality.

## 4. User Interface Design
- Design a modern and user-friendly interface that includes:
  - Intuitive navigation for seamless user experience.
  - Visually appealing design with modern aesthetics.
  - Responsive layout for compatibility across devices.
  - Features such as tabs for multiple terminal sessions and split panes for side-by-side views.
  - Customizable themes to allow user personalization.
  - Contextual menus and shortcuts for efficient navigation.
- Create wireframes and prototypes for user testing using tools such as Figma or Adobe XD.

## 5. Implementation Plan
- Break down the development process into tasks and milestones, including:
  - Setting up the development environment.
  - Implementing the terminal emulator.
  - Designing the user interface.
  - Integrating backend services.
  - Conducting user testing and feedback sessions.
- Assign responsibilities and set deadlines for each task, using tools or methodologies such as Agile, Jira, or Trello to streamline task management and ensure accountability.

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance
- Establish a testing strategy, including:
  - Unit Testing: Implement unit tests for individual components and functions to ensure they work as intended.
  - Integration Testing: Test the interactions between different components to verify that they work together correctly.
  - End-to-End Testing: Conduct tests that simulate user interactions with the application to ensure the entire system functions as expected.
  - Automated Testing: Utilize automated testing frameworks to streamline the testing process and ensure consistent results.
  - User Feedback: Plan for user feedback sessions to gather insights on usability and functionality, allowing for iterative improvements based on real user experiences.
  - Bug Tracking: Establish a system for tracking bugs and issues that arise during testing, ensuring they are addressed promptly.
  - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Implement CI/CD practices to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring that new changes are tested and deployed efficiently.

## 7. Deployment and Maintenance
- Define the deployment process, including:
  - Packaging: Specify how the application will be packaged for personal use, including any necessary dependencies.
  - Distribution: Focus on local installation rather than distribution through platforms (e.g., GitHub releases, package managers, app stores).
  - Installation Instructions: Provide clear instructions for personal installation.
- Establish environment configuration, including any environment variables (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`, `LOG_LEVEL`) or configuration files (e.g., `config.json`, `.env`) needed for different environments (development, staging, production).
- Implement monitoring and logging to track application performance and capture errors for troubleshooting.
- Set up a support system for users to report issues or seek help, such as using GitHub Issues, a dedicated support email, or a help desk platform like Zendesk or Freshdesk.
- Plan for regular updates to the application, including bug fixes and new features based on personal usage and feedback.

## 8. MCP Integration
- **MCP Server Setup**: Outline the steps to set up an MCP server that can be used within the application, including defining the server's capabilities and interactions.
- **Integration with Application**: Describe how the application will communicate with the MCP server, including necessary API calls and data handling.
- **Use Cases**: Identify specific use cases for MCP within the application, such as fetching data from external APIs or performing tasks that enhance terminal functionality.
- **Testing MCP Integration**: Plan for testing the integration of MCP to ensure it works seamlessly with the application.
