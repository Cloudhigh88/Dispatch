# Knowledge Feature in Warp

## Overview
The Knowledge feature in Warp allows users to create and store rules that provide context for Agent Mode interactions, enabling smarter and more tailored assistance. These rules can include coding standards, project guidelines, and user-specific preferences.

## Accessing the Knowledge Feature
You can access the Knowledge feature through several methods:
- From the Warp Drive, navigate to **Personal > Rules**.
- Use the Command Palette and search for **Open AI Rules**.
- From the Settings panel, go to **Settings > AI > Manage Rules**.
- On macOS, access it via the menu: **AI > Open Rules**.

## Managing Knowledge
In the Rules pane, users can:
- **Add**: Create new rules with an optional name and description.
- **Edit**: Modify existing rules as needed.
- **Delete**: Remove any number of rules from the list.

## Knowledge as Agent Mode Context
Agent Mode can leverage the rules you create to tailor its responses. Rules that are pulled as context will be displayed in the conversation as citations under "References" or "derived from."
