# Command Entry in Warp

## Overview
Warp's Command Entry features enhance the user experience by providing tools for command corrections, searching, history management, synchronized inputs, and YAML workflows.

## Features of Command Entry

### 1. Command Corrections
- Provides auto-correct suggestions on previously run commands to catch typos, forgotten flags, and fix general console errors.
- This feature helps users quickly correct mistakes without needing to retype commands.

### 2. Command Search
- A 3-in-1 panel that allows users to search across Command History, Workflows, Notebooks, and A.I. Command Search all at once.
- This feature streamlines the process of finding previously used commands and workflows.

### 3. Command History
- Isolates the history of each shell session, making previously run commands easily accessible.
- Users can quickly reference and reuse commands from their session history.

### 4. Synchronized Inputs
- Allows users to easily run the same command in multiple sessions at the same time.
- This feature is particularly useful for collaborative work or when managing multiple terminal sessions.

### 5. YAML Workflows
- Facilitates the execution and sharing of parameterized and searchable commands within Warp.
- YAML workflows make it easier to manage complex command sequences and share them with others.
