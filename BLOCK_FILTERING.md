# Block Filtering in Warp

## Overview
Block Filtering allows users to quickly filter and focus on a subset of a Block's output in Warp. This feature enhances usability by enabling users to find relevant information efficiently without deleting any output lines.

## How to Filter a Block
To apply a filter to a Block:
1. Click on the **filter icon** in the top right corner of a Block. A filter editor will appear with a large input field and two buttons on the left, along with a smaller input field on the right.
2. Type in the input to filter the Block in the left input field. Only lines containing text that matches the filter query will be shown.
3. (Optional) Click on the **regex**, **case sensitive search**, or **invert filter** buttons to enable those options.
4. (Optional) Type a number in the right input field to add context lines around matched lines.

### Toggling Filters
You can also toggle a filter on/off by:
- Using the keybinding **ALT-SHIFT-F** to toggle filtering on the selected or latest Block.
- Selecting **Toggle Block Filter** in the Block context menu.

Toggling a filter on a Block without a filter applied will open the filter editor. If you toggle a filter off, the same filter will be applied if you toggle filtering on again.

This guide will assist users in understanding and utilizing Block Filtering effectively within the Warp terminal.
