# Block Actions in Warp

## Overview
Block Actions enhance the functionality of Blocks in Warp, allowing users to manage and interact with their commands and outputs more effectively.

## Accessing Block Actions
There are two ways to access Block Actions:
1. **Hover over a Block** and click the kebab (three dots) button on the right-hand side.
2. **Right-click a Block** to access the context menu.

## Features of Block Actions

### 1. Copy Input / Output of Block
- Easily copy the Block command, output, or both for reuse or sharing.

### 2. Sharing a Block
- Share a Block with coworkers or teammates by creating a web permalink. This preserves formatting and makes debugging and sharing output easy. Refer to the Block Sharing Page for more details.

### 3. Bookmarking a Block
- Quickly navigate to important Blocks regardless of their position in the terminal history.
- **Ways to Bookmark a Block**:
  - Select **Toggle bookmark** in the block context menu.
  - Use the **CMD-B** keybinding to bookmark a selected Block.
- **Navigating to a Bookmarked Block**:
  - Click on the bookmark indicator, which reflects the approximate position of the Block in the history. Hovering over the indicator will show a snapshot of the Block, including its prompt, command, and the last two lines of output.
  - Press **OPTION-UP** and **OPTION-DOWN** to navigate through bookmarked Blocks.
- Note: Bookmarks only persist while the session is open. Once the session is closed, bookmarks are lost. To save the command and output for later use, share the Block.

### 4. Search Within a Block
- Quickly find important information within a Block.
- With a Block selected, press **"Find Within Block"** or use **CMD-F** to search within the Block.

### 5. Filtering a Block
- Filter the output lines of a Block natively in Warp to focus on a specific subset of the Block. Refer to the Block Filtering Page for more information.

This guide will assist users in understanding and utilizing Block Actions effectively within the Warp terminal.
