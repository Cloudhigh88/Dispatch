# Find in Warp

## Overview
The Find feature in Warp operates differently than in traditional terminals or text editors. Instead of searching from the lowest point in view or from the top, Find searches for matches in all your Blocks from the bottom up.

## Features of Find

### What is Find?
- Find searches for matches across all command outputs contained within Blocks.

  - Enable the regex toggle for regular expression searches.
